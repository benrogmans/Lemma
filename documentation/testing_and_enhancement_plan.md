# Lemma Testing and Enhancement Plan

## Phase 1: Reliability and Robustness

### Error Recovery Testing

Create new test file: `lemma/tests/error_recovery_test.rs`

Test robustness against:

- Malformed input at every stage (lexing, parsing, validation, transpilation)
- Invalid fact overrides
- Missing required facts
- Circular document references (should be caught by semantic validator)
- **Cross-document rule references** - Currently not properly implemented and cause evaluation failures
- Invalid type conversions
- Evaluation failures
- Resource exhaustion scenarios

Target: All errors produce helpful messages with source locations

**Known Issue**: Cross-document rule references are not fully supported and may cause runtime errors during evaluation. This needs investigation and proper implementation or explicit error handling.

### Security Audit

Review and harden parser and evaluator code:

**File: `lemma/src/parser/literals.rs`**

- String escaping and validation
- Special character handling
- Injection prevention

**File: `lemma/src/parser/facts.rs`**

- Identifier sanitization
- Name validation correctness

**File: `lemma/src/evaluator/`**

- User input validation in evaluation

Create test file: `lemma/tests/security_test.rs`

- Test with malicious strings: quotes, backslashes, control characters
- Code injection-style patterns
- Code injection attempts
- Path traversal attempts in document names

### Stress and Scale Testing

Create new test file: `lemma/tests/stress_test.rs`

Test scenarios:

- Large documents (1000+ facts, 1000+ rules)
- Deep rule reference chains (100+ levels)
- Wide document hierarchies (100+ child documents)
- Complex expressions (deeply nested operations)
- Many small documents (1000+ in workspace)
- Rapid repeated evaluations (10000+ queries)
- Memory usage patterns over time

Target: Identify performance bottlenecks and memory leaks

### Benchmarking Suite

Create `lemma/benches/lemma_benchmarks.rs` using Criterion

Benchmark operations:

- Parse time: small/medium/large documents
- Transpilation time
- End-to-end evaluation time
- Fact override evaluation
- Unit conversions
- Date arithmetic
- Complex rule chains
- Document composition

Target: Establish performance baselines and detect regressions

## Phase 2: Documentation Updates

### Write Testing Guide

Create `documentation/testing.md`:

- How to run tests
- How to write property-based tests
- How to use fuzzing
- How to run benchmarks
- Testing best practices
