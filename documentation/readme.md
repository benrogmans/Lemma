# A declarative language for business rules

Lemma is a pure, declarative and open source programming language for business rules, that is easy to read for non-technical stakeholders. Rules are written in Specs that humans can read and systems can evaluate precisely and deterministically. Lemma validates Rules before they can be evaluated. Errors are impossible: Rules return a value or Veto, and optionally an explanation when you ask for one (`--explain` / `explain: true`).

```lemma
spec pricing 2026-01-01
"""
Applies a tiered discount and VAT to the base price, 
effective from 2026-01-01.
"""

data base_price: 100
data is_member:  false
data quantity:   number

rule discount: 0%
  unless quantity >= 10  then 10%
  unless quantity >= 50  then 15%
  unless is_member       then 20%

rule discount_amount: base_price * discount
rule discounted_price: base_price - discount_amount

rule vat: discounted_price * 21%
rule total: discounted_price + vat
```

## Get started

If you have Cargo installed, you can run:

```bash
cargo install lemma
```

If you are using npm:

```bash
npm install -g lemma
```

Precompiled binaries for Linux, macOS, and Windows are included in the npm package automatically. Docker images are also available. See [Installation](installation.md) for all options.

## Writing your first Spec

Write a `.lemma` file and run it. The [Learn guide](learn/readme.md) walks you through everything from your first Spec to composing Rules across time and registries. You'll be productive in minute.
