# Python ports of the Lemma benchmark specs

Hand-written Python implementations of the three Lemma specs in
[`../specs/`](../specs). Used as the Python side of the hand-written Lemma vs
hand-written Python comparison in
[`../../../cli/documentation/reference/benchmarks/engine.md`](../../../cli/documentation/reference/benchmarks/engine.md).

Arithmetic uses `fractions.Fraction` (exact rationals) to match Lemma's
`RationalInteger`. Rounding types (`Decimal`, `float`) are out of scope.
Literal constants are module-level (import time), the analogue of Lemma
plan-time literal parsing. `compute_terminal` evaluates only the terminal
rule's dependency closure.

## Per-call boundary (latency)

Cross-language latency compares steady-state evaluation only (C-vs-Python model):

- **Lemma**: compile once (`load` before measurement); timed = inline input literals + `Engine::run` → terminal rule
- **Python**: import once before measurement; timed = inline input literals + `build_inputs(raw)` + `compute_terminal(inputs)`

Lemma compile cost is reported separately, not in the Python/Lemma ratio. No disk I/O. No JSON input sidecars.

## Running

```sh
python3 benchmark.py          # standalone JSON to stdout
cargo benchmarks engine     # full report from workspace root
```
